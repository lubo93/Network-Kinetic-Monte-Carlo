# Network-Kinetic-Monte-Carlo
This repository contains an implementation of a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate dynamical processes on arbitrary networks using the Boost Graph Library (GBL).

I used such a kinetic Monte Carlo routine for simulating the dynamics described in: L. BÃ¶ttcher, J. Nagler, H.J. Herrmann, Critical Behaviors in Contagion Dynamics, Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 088301 (2017).

More information on GBL can be found here: https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_66_0/libs/graph/doc/

The network example is taken from: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/egonets-Facebook.html
